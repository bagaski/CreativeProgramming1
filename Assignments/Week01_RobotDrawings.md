# ROBOT DRAWINGS

**DUE: SEPTEMBER 10**  

Today we have amazingly deep programs for making art using computers, like Photoshop and Maya. But the concepts behind these tools is the same as it was in the earliest days of computer graphics: basic shapes, a coordinate system, pixels and colors on a screen. This week, we'll explore these as our toolset and get more familiar thinking about images as numbers and positions.

Building on the code examples you learned today, your assignment is to generate one drawing of a robot using only code. Use any combination of shapes, color, stroke, transparency, etc to make your robots as detailed as possible. **Your sketch should be 800 x 800 pixels, and exported as a PNG file.**

Create a sketch with this basic structure:

    void setup() {
    	size(800,800);

    	// code to draw your robot here!

    	// save your robot, but be sure to change the filename
    	save("LastnameFirstname_ROBOT.png");
    }

If you already have some coding experience, please try to just use the methods we learned today – adding fancy code and leveraging what you know will be encouraged later, but for now I'd like you to get used to the coordinate system and Processing's drawing functions. Think about how to leverage these simple tools (gradients drawn with lots of shapes of varying color, for example). Making functions to clean up your code is ok, but no for loops or animation please!


## DELIVERABLES  

* Exported `png` image of your robot, with the correct filename, uploaded to Canvas  
* No need to upload your code – we'll take a look at it in class next week  


## STRETCH GOALS  

Want to make your robot really awesome? Try these challenges:

* Show your robot from multiple angles, either as separate sketches or all in the same one!  
* Make your image resizable using `width` and `height` instead of set `x/y` positions  
* Try adding shading to your robot, and/or drawing in perspective!
