CLOCKS
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 5

This week, we've seen some basic ways of turning a static sketch into an animated one, and in the coming weeks we'll build on this even more, going from animated to interactive. [John Maeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda) – an artist, designer, educator, and creator of [Design By Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_By_Numbers) (which led to Processing) – made a series of experimental clocks (seen above) as a way of thinking about designing with code. Your assignment, inspired by Maeda's work and the other examples we looked at, is to create your own visual, non-traditional clocks using code.

Think about ways of showing time that are interesting visually, conceptually, or poetically. Your clocks don't need to be easy to read, or even useful! Should they measure traditional units of time, or something personal, biological, political, or unusual? Consider timescale and [alternative divisions of time](https://youtu.be/At5atF4mKiU), and how you can use the built-in `hour()`, `minute()`, `second()`, and `millis()` to drive visuals onscreen. Try to push past the obvious first ideas and into something suprising.

We'll also have our first quiz next week – if you missed our study session in class, see [the notes](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/blob/master/Quizzes/Quiz1.pdf).

*Above: a gif of John Maeda's "12 Clocks," created in 1996-97 using his language Design By Numbers – gif via [Golan Levin](http://cmuems.com/2016/60212/lectures/lecture-09-09b-clocks/maedas-clocks/).*  

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* Can you add boolean "flags" to your code, allowing multiple modes for your clock to take?  
* Can you record an animated gif of your piece? Use [this library](https://github.com/01010101/GifAnimation) and the sample code in this week's `code` folder  

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
* Your project should show time in an interesting, visual way that isn't just a traditional clock  
* Name your sketch `LastnameFirstname_CLOCK`  
* Your sketch can be any size, but think about how that changes our experience of your clock  
* When done, create an image of your clock running, either using the `save()` command or a cropped screenshot  
* Zip your sketch, with the image insize, and upload it to Canvas before the start of class  

### READING  
For next week, please also read:

* Richard Stallman's [*Free Software Is Even More Important Now*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)  
* Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the [*Constitution for the Debian Project*](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution)  
* The [Debian Social Contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract) and [*What Does Free Mean?*](https://www.debian.org/intro/free)  
* Creative Commons' [*License Considerations*](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-considerations/)  

Optional, but you might also want to check out, most all of which are in the `Readings` folder:  

* Gabriella Coleman's excellent book [*Coding Freedom*](http://gabriellacoleman.org/Coleman-Coding-Freedom.pdf) (available free online as a PDF)  
* *Computer Lib/Dream Machines* by Ted Nelson  
* *Two Bits: The Cultural Significance of Free Software* by Christopher Kelty  
* [*The Debian Manifesto*](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ap-manifesto.en.html#sA.2)  
* Richard Stallman's [*Motives for Writing Free Software*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fs-motives.html)  
* [*Introduction to Linux: A Brief History of Linux*](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/gs/node3.html)  
* And a few other random PDfs, stuffed in this week's `Readings` folder...  

Think about how sharing code fits into your view of ownership and making money, and write up a short response (2-3 paragraphs) and publish it as an "issue" here, like you did in the first week. Title your issue `Firstname Lastname: Open Source Response`. Be specific! Why does the idea of open source and free software appeal to you, or why do you find it difficult to get behind?
