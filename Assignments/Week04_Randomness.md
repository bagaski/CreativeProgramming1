# RANDOMNESS

**DUE: TUESDAY, OCT 8**  

> "The computer is a unique device for the arts since it can function soley as an obedient tool with vast capabilities for controlling complicated and involved processes, but then again, full exploitation of its unique talents for controlled randomness and detailed algorithms could result in an entirely new machine â€“Â a creative artistic medium." â€“Â A. Michael Noll (1970)

For this project, we'll look at how randomness can be a creative tool, both breaking the computer's determinism and taking advantage of its capacity to quickly create ([seemingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandomness)) random values, which can be used to drive any visual parameter in your sketch: position, size, rotation, color, number of iterations, etc.

Code that uses randomness will generate different outputs every time it's run, which can be really exciting! Remember the idea of iterative development: run your sketch many times and keep the outputs that you like best. This can be exciting if not a little weird: it removes your artistic hand somewhat, leaving you to act as coordinator (writing code) and curator (selecting output to show).

## DELIVERABLES  

* Three or more initial code sketches, exported as `PDF` or `TIFF` and printed on `11x17"` paper in the Fab Lab  
* Final output, `PDF` or `TIFF` uploaded to Canvas and printed version brought to class  


## STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* Can you add the random parameters automatically to your exported filename, so you could recreate the image later?  
* Could you use a hardware-based random number generation method (dice, coin toss, an algorithm of your own devising) to use as the `randomSeed()` every time you run your program? How could that be wrapped into the conceptual idea of your project?  


## FOR TUESDAY, OCT 1  
For next week, please create at least three different exploratory studies in code thinking about randomness. These should show a range of ideas and explore potential directions for the project. Think about all the ideas we've used so far (basic shape commands, iteration, design principles) and how you might apply randomness to them. 

Sketches should be `1152x720 pixels` (that's `16x10" * 72 pixels per inch`); either orientation is ok. **Please export your files as either `PDF` or `TIFF` and print all three in the Fab Lab or FedEx.** Remember that craft and presentation counts, so don't fold or mangle your prints.

**Please also read the two PDFs in this week's `Readings` folder on Open Source software and write up two questions/reactions you'd like to discuss. Upload this as a comment on this assignment in Canvas.**


## FOR TUESDAY, OCT 8  
**Note! Jeff is out of town next week, so we will not meet as a class. Instead, turn in this project to Canvas and see the new assignment on Github.**

For next week, please take your initial randomness studies and create a final iteration. Push the visual explorations you did last week: what happens when you layer more randomized parameters, layer things, or create systems driven by other systems? How might you take a simple idea and push it to something beautiful (like Vera Molnar's deformed squares)?

Your sketch should be the same size as last week (`1152x720 pixels`, exported as `PDF` or `TIFF`). Since we won't be meeting in person, please just upload these images to Canvas.
