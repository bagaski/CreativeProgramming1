INTERACTIVITY
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 12

In his paper *The Art of Interaction: Interactivity, Performativity, and Computers* (found in the `Readings` folder), David Saltz describes interactive art having an input device that translates one's behavior into digital form, that the input data affects the output, and that the output is translated back into real-world phenomena that we can perceive, all in real-time. This week, your assignment is to build a sketch that is interactive in some way, responding to mouse and/or keyboard input.

Think about all the ways of drawing we've covered so far; it may also be helpful to think back to the first week, when a simple set of instructions transformed into surprising drawings. How you approach this, and what it looks like, is up to you, but the result should be a unique exploration of interactivity and the visual.

Think about ways the mouse and keyboard could change:

* Position (follow mouse, flee away, move back-and-forth, still/motion)  
* Size (things get bigger, smaller, appear, disappear)  
* Shape (number of sides, switch between shapes)  
* Rotation (angle, faster/slower, start/stop)  
* Color (shift or flicker, `lerpColor()`, HSB mode)  
* How many of something (end condition of for-loop or recursion)  
* Complex conditions (nest if/else statements depending on interaction)  

Remember! The way your finished code interacts with the viewer and the results it creates are what's important: great code + boring output = boring art.

In addition to the sketch's interactive functionality, please add a way to export still images (perhaps a key or combination of keys, saved with a timestamp). Save at least two images of your sketch and include in your upload.

### STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* How can you combine the keyboard and mouse for more complex, rich interaction? Could the basic drawing tool be modified by the keyboard in some way?  
* Can you document your sketch and create a Github repository for it as an open source project?  

### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  
* Your project should use interactivity through mouse and/or keyboard input to create a unique visual experience  
* Name your sketch `LastnameFirstname_Interactivity`  
* Your sketch can be any size, but think about how that changes our experience of it  
* Add a means of saving images of your sketch running and output at least two images of it running  
* Zip your sketch, with the images inside, and upload to Canvas before the start of class  
* Write up a response to this week's readings (info below)  

### READING  
For next week, please also read these articles, found in the `Readings > Open Source` folder:

* *Motives for Writing Free Software* by the Free Software Foundation  
* Richard Stallman's [*Free Software Is Even More Important Now*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html)  

Optional, but you might also want to check out, most all of which are in the same folder:  

* Sections 1, 2, and 3 of the [*Constitution for the Debian Project*](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution)  
* The [Debian Social Contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract) and [*What Does Free Mean?*](https://www.debian.org/intro/free)  
* Creative Commons' [*License Considerations*](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-considerations/)  * Gabriella Coleman's excellent book [*Coding Freedom*](http://gabriellacoleman.org/Coleman-Coding-Freedom.pdf) (available free online as a PDF)  
* *Computer Lib/Dream Machines* by Ted Nelson  
* *Two Bits: The Cultural Significance of Free Software* by Christopher Kelty  
* [*The Debian Manifesto*](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/ap-manifesto.en.html#sA.2)  
* Richard Stallman's [*Motives for Writing Free Software*](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/fs-motives.html)  
* [*Introduction to Linux: A Brief History of Linux*](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/gs/node3.html)  
* And a few other random PDfs, stuffed in the `Open Source` readings folder...  

Think about how sharing code fits into your view of ownership and making money, and write up a short response (2-3 paragraphs) and publish it as an "issue" here, like you did in the first week. Title your issue `Firstname Lastname: Open Source Response`. Be specific! Why does the idea of open source and free software appeal to you, or why do you find it difficult to get behind?

### GRADING RUBRIC  
Your project will be graded with the following rubric:

**10%:** Project meets technical requirements (correct file format, naming convention, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows creativity, attention to visual quality (composition, color, etc)  
**30%:** Project shows clear use of technical material covered in class  
**30%:** Project shows investigation and exploration of assignment topic
