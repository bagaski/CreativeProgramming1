# COLLAGE  

**DUE: TUESDAY, OCT 22**  

>"Sometimes I consider myself a fisherman. Computer programs and ideas are the hooks, rods, and reels. Computer pictures are the trophies and delicious meals. A fisherman does not always know what the waters will yield... Often the specific catch is a surprise."
>— Clifford Pickover, *Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty* (1990)

So far we've only used Processing's drawing commands – rectangles, lines, circles, etc. And while those ideas still underpin all the things we do with computer graphics, dealing only with shapes would miss out on so many other things. As a way to start experimenting with photographic images in code, for this project you'll make a collage in Processing.

Your first step will be gathering source images to work with. Think about these images as both a source of color and texture as well as having the potential to add meaningful context to your image. Google Image Search will be a good start, but also consider taking your own photos, scanning objects, etc as source material!

Once gathered, use the ideas we've covered so far to make a collage that layers these images or parts of them into a new composition. Think about structures like for-loops that will let you tile images or create repeating patterns. Randomness may also be a useful tool, though you don't have to use it if you'd prefer a more controlled composition.

**Note! We won't meet next week, since it's a Monday schedule. If you have any questions, want feedback, or need technical help, please stop by my office or send me an email!**

## DELIVERABLES  

* Collage sketch, any dimensions  
* Exported as `PNG` file, titled `LastnameFirstname-Collage.png` and uploaded to Canvas (no need to print this week)


## STRETCH GOALS  
Try adding these elements to your sketch:

* In Creative Programming 2, we do a lot more image processing projects. Included in this week's `Code` folder, you'll find some extra examples on how to access individual pixels from an image. Can you play with modifying the source image before collaging it?


## PROJECTS SHOWN
