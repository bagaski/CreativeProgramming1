# INTERACTIVITY  

**DUE: TUESDAY, OCT 29**  

TLDR: make something interactive and read text in the `Critical Code Studies` folder (posting a response as a comment in the assignment)  

So far we've only created static images, but that leaves out a huge part of what Processing can do! As a way of starting to think about interactivity (and, later, animation) we'll create sketches that respond to mouse and keyboard input. In his paper *The Art of Interaction: Interactivity, Performativity, and Computers* (found in the `Readings` folder), David Saltz describes interactive art having three things: 

* An input device that translates one's behavior into digital form  
* That the input data affects the output  
* And that the output is translated back into real-world phenomena that we can perceive, all in real-time  

This week, your assignment is to build a sketch that responds to mouse and/or keyboard input in a visual way. How you approach this, and what it looks like, is up to you, but the result should be a unique exploration of interactivity and the visual.

Think about ways the mouse and keyboard could change:

* Position (stillness, motion, speed)  
* Size (things get bigger, smaller, appear, disappear)  
* Shape (number of sides, switch between shapes)  
* Rotation (angle, faster/slower, start/stop)  
* Color (shift or flicker, `lerpColor()`, HSB mode)  
* How many of something (end condition of for-loop or recursion)  
* Complex conditions (nest if/else statements depending on interaction)  
* Constraining movement or changes using `map()`  

Remember! The way your finished code interacts with the viewer and the visual results it creates are what's important: fancy code + boring output = boring art. Same goes for ["feature creep"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) (aka the potpourri approach). Don't worry about trying to build a drawing app or physics simulation; instead, try thinking about ways to make the kinds of sketches you've created so far change using mouse and keyboard input.

## DELIVERABLES  

* Interactive sketch that uses mouse input (keyboard optional)  
* Any dimensions, running in fullscreen mode  
* 3 images of the program running, either exported as `PNG` file using keyboard commands or screenshots  
* Read the exceprt from *10 PRINT CHR$* in the `Critical Code Studies` folder, found in the `Readings` section; write up a 1-paragraph response and post it as a comment on the assigment
