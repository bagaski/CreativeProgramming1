# ANIMATION

**DUE: TUESDAY, NOV 19**  

Building on the ideas of interactivity we explored, as our last regular project your task is to create an animation in Processing with three scenes. While doing Pixar-level animation (or even cell animation like Looney Toons) is not really possible with the tools we have, we can explore motion, time, and change by making shapes and images move. For some prompts to consider, see the `Resources` folder for this week.

You three "scenes" should be distinct parts that come one after another. This might be based on a `millis()` or `frameCount` timer, or a condition being met (like an object reaching a certain point). You should think about your sketch as a generative film: scenes that feel like parts of a cohesive whole. If you want, you can also consider adding sound using Processing's `Sound` library or `Minim`, though it's not required.

*Above: a still from John Whitney's "Catalog." Made in 1961 using a decommissioned WW2-era M-5 Antiaircraft Gun Director, "Catalog" is what its name implies: a catalog of visual effects at the birth of computer graphics. ([More info here](https://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.5/2.5pages/2.5moritzwhitney.html), including a picture of Whitney's computer.)*  


## DELIVERABLES  

* Initial scene for your animation  
* Final animation, running on its own as a fullscreen sketch  
* Screenshots of each of your scenes, uploaded to Canvas  


## FOR TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 12  
For next week, please create one scene for your animation. Think about the demos and examples shown, then try to create a visually compelling animated scene that uses the tools and ideas covered so far. Your sketch should run fullscreen, so you'll want to use `width` and `height` as much as possible and think about your composition in that format.

Next week we'll take a look at your first scenes, then do some more animation demos and have work time.

This is a two-week project, so we won't be covering all the demos in the first week. Feel free to jump ahead and take a look at the other demos if there's something you want to try. If there's other stuff you want to know how to do for your project, come next week with questions and I'll do my best to show you!
