# FINAL PROJECT  

**FINAL CRITIQUE: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3**  
**PROJECT DOCUMENTATION: TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17 AT 1PM**  

Your final project for the semester is to make something, anything, using Processing. The choice of what you'll make and what format it's output will be (screen, interactive, printed, projected) are up to you. Whatever you decide, it should be an ambitious project that is worthy of two weeks' of work, and that pushes your artistic, creative, and technical skills. Feel free to involve non-computational media (drawing, photography, illustration, music) if you want alongside or with your code.

The goal should be a project that you're personally invested in and that you procrastinate all other projects to work on!


## DELIVERABLES  
* Rough prototype of your project  
* Finished work for critique on the last day of class  
* Project documentation uploaded to Canvas (see details below)  


## PROJECT CALENDAR  
**Nov 19:** Final project assigned, work on project ideas and sketches prototypes  
**Nov 26:** Rough prototypes due, demos of work in progress and work day  
**Dec 3:** Final critique  
**Dec 17 by 1pm:** Documentation of finished work due, uploaded to Canvas (we won't meet in class)  


## FOR TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26  
For next week, start work on your project with the goal of rough prototypes for next week. These don't need to be working perfectly, but should be far enough along for us to give feedback without a ton of explanation: "show, not tell." We'll do a quick feedback session and have some work time. Note this next week is our last class before the crit, so bring code questions and things you need help with.

**TROUBLE COMING UP WITH IDEAS?**  
As a jumping off point, think about things you've enjoyed doing this semester, and things that you're generally obsessed with. If you love binge-watching crappy 80s TV, maybe a project that collages hundreds of frames of video from those shows. If you are super into language, maybe a poem-generating sketch that outputs printable book PDFs with auto-generated illustrations. The best projects are the ones that connect what we do in class with things you care about.


## FOR TUESDAY, DECEMBER 3  
For next week, please have your project ready at the start of class for our critique – late work will not be given feedback. Projects shown on the projector on a laptop should be intentionally screen-based; print work should be ready to be hung. The Fab Lab is open this week but will probably be busy, so give yourself enough lead-time.

I'll hold office hours and other times you can drop in for technical help before the project is due this next week – see my office door for available times. Try to take advantage of this and get work done early, so you can spot technical problems!

We'll take a look at your work and you can use that feedback to improve your project before the final turn-in on Dec 17.


## FOR TUESDAY, DECEMBER 17 AT 1pm – ONLINE TURN-IN!  
**Note, we will NOT meet this week!** Turn in documentation of your project on Canvas only.

What to turn in:  
* Representative image (screenshot, photograph, etc) of your project  
* For interactive or animation work: your sketch folder, zipped  
* For print work: digital files used to print (optional: install shots too)  
* For physical work (books, sculpture, etc): digital files **and** photographs of the project, taken carefully in the right context and with decent lighting  
* Other formats: please chat with me individually  

Work is due at 1pm – late work cannot be accepted, so please be sure it is uploaded in time. If you have any questions, you can reach me by email.
