FINAL PROJECT
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21

>"A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren't flexible. Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it." – Marvin Minsky

Your final project for the semester is to make something, anything, using at least one of the tools covered in class this semester. The choice of what you'll make and what format it's output will be (screen, interactive, printed, projected) are up to you. Whatever you decide, it should be an ambitious project that is worthy of four weeks' of work, and that pushes your artistic, creative, and technical skills. Feel free to involve non-computational media (drawing, photography, illustration, music) if you want alongside or with your code.

The goal should be a project that you're personally invested in, and that you procrastinate all other projects to work on!

### PROJECT CALENDAR  
**Nov 15:** Final project assigned, work on project proposals and rough prototypes.  
**Nov 30:** Jeff out of town, no class! Continue working on projects.  
**Dec 7:** Rough prototypes due, demos of work in progress and work day.  
**Dec 21:** Final projects due uploaded to Canvas and updated Wiki page with project documentation due.  

### FOR THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30  
Please write a written proposal outlining the project you want to make. This should be specific, and include details of what you want to work on, why this project, and inspiration. Instead of just writing up ideas in a Word document, you should [create a Wiki page](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/wiki) on the class Github repo. Click the [New Page button](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/wiki/_new), and title your page `Final Project: Your Name`. Use [the template I've made](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming1/wiki/Example-Template), changing it to fit your project. See the template for details on what your proposal should include as well. We'll use this page later to document your project when it's finished.  

**TROUBLE COMING UP WITH IDEAS?**  
As a jumping off point, think about things you've enjoyed doing this semester, and things that you're generally obsessed with. If you love binge-watching crappy 80s TV, maybe a project that manipulates or analyzes millions of frames of video from those shows. If you are super into language, maybe a poem-generating sketch that outputs printable book PDFs with auto-generated illustrations.

I'll give you written feedback on your proposals, though **we won't have class the week of Nov 30.** Please also start working on your projects over the Thanskgiving break – you'll have a rough prototype due December 7.

### FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 7    
You should have already started working on your final project, and this week you should bring a rough prototype. It doesn't need to all be working, but should be far enough along for us to give feedback without a ton of explanation: "show, not tell." We'll do quick feedback sessions and have some work time. Note this is our last week to talk, so bring code questions and things you need help with.

I'll hold office hours and other times you can drop in for technical help before the project is due. Try to take advantage of this and get work done early, so you can spot technical problems.

### FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 21    
**Note that this is an online turn-in only! We won't have an in-person crit of your projects.** There are a few things you need to do to turn these in, so please read this carefully.

**PROJECT FILES**  
Project files should be in a folder, titled `LastnameFirstname_FinalProject`, and uploaded to Canvas.

**DOCUMENTATION IN THE WIKI**  
You should update your proposal's Wiki page to document the finished project:  

* Change the language for intro, `Detailed Description`, and `Why?` sections to reflect the finished project.  
* Change the `Technical Needs` to list the tools and resources actually you used.  
* Keep the inspiration images, and add more if you like.  
* Include at least three images of the project – this might be screenshots of it running, output from your code, etc. Curate images that show your project clearly, and include descriptions below them, just like for the inspiration images.  
* Anything else you want to include is great! What are some things you learned with this project? Is there some particularly great code you want to show off?

This documentation is what I'll primarily use to grade your projects, so please take your time like you would with a project report or paper.
