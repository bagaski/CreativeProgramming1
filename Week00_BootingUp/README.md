# BOOTING UP  

### TLDR  
* Due September 8 by 12pm EST  
* Make a drawing using instructions you create  
* Upload a photo or scan of your drawing to Canvas  
* Type the instructions used to create it as a comment on your submission  
* Read *Computer Graphics* by Manfred Mohr    


### ASSIGNMENT  

> "The idea becomes a machine that makes the art." – Sol LeWitt  

As a way to start thinking about writing code, but without the hassle of learning syntax and finding missing semicolons, we're going to make some drawings ~together~ using instructions that define what marks we can make and where they go. This mimics a few things that happen when we run code: instructions are carried out exactly as they are written, that suprising things can result from limited instructions, and that there is a rich and interesting tradition of artists and designers working this way. 

Please read Manfred Mohr's *Computer Graphics* essay in the `Readings` folder and, using it and our in-class work as inspiration, create a more involved drawing using instructions you create. You will want to experiment and test what different instructions and variations will do – this is called "iterative development" and is exactly what we'll do when we start writing code! You can make your drawing collaboratively or by yourself. Think about the drawings we made in class together, and Mohr's essay – feel free to embrace or push against the idea of instructions defining a creative act like drawing.

The goal is a much more fully-developed drawing that produces surprising results and feels finished. The drawings should fill an `8.5x11"` sheet of paper or larger (`larger == better`, probably), and should include a separate set of written instructions. Consider also the presentation of your drawing and instructions: keep everything neat and clean, select drawing implements that make sense for your particular instructions, fonts for the instruction sheet, etc. 


### DELIVERABLES    
* A drawing made following your instructions, filling at least `8.5x11"`  
* Drawing uploaded to the assignment on Canvas (either a photo or scan), with your instructions typed up as a comment on your submission  

:heavy_exclamation_mark: If you have any problems with Canvas or the assignment, don't hesitate to email me or drop into my Zoom hours! Since we'll be working with technical material (and will be nearly all online this semester) it's important you be proactive in getting help. Don't be shy!


### STRETCH GOALS  
If you get really excited about your instruction drawing, here's a few things you can try:

* Carry out the instructions a few different times and see how the results differ (they may also form a nice [diptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diptych) or [triptych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triptych))  
* Ask other people to do a drawing from your instructions and compare the results  


### IN-CLASS DRAWINGS  
Below are some of the exercises we did together in class. The first few are inspired by [Zach Lieberman](http://thesystemis.com) (who also does really cool work with code and art, btw). In all of these, it's best not to think too much – just make marks quickly and see what results from the accumulation!

1. Each member of your group should draw a dot on the page, one at a time, in a point that is as far from other dots as possible. Repeat many times and as quickly as possible.  

2. Draw one straight line of any length and angle. Each person should draw another straight line off from the end of an existing line, plus add a new straight line somewhere else on the page. No lines should touch any other. Repeat.  

3. Draw a blob somewhere on the page. Each person should draw a new blob that intersects with another blob and doesn't touch any others. Repeat.  

4. Draw a curving line in from the edge of the paper. Each person should draw another curving line from the edge, not touching any other lines. Repeat.   

5. Using the pre-printed shapes, draw a series of evenly-spaced points along the edge, about 20-30 of them. Pass the person on your right. On this new sheet, write a set of simple instructions about what to do from these points. Pass to the right again and carry out the instructions on this new sheet.

6. From Sol LeWitt, using pre-printed templates. (Our twist: draw in one square, then pass to the person on your right.)  
`WORK FROM INSTRUCTIONS (1971):`  
`USING A BLACK, HARD CRAYON DRAW A TWENTY INCH SQUARE.`  
`DIVIDE THIS SQUARE INTO ONE INCH SQUARES. WITHIN EACH`  
`ONE INCH SQUARE, DRAW NOTHING, OR DRAW A DIAGONAL`  
`STRAIGHT LINE FROM CORNER TO CORNER OR TWO CROSSING`  
`STRAIGHT LINES DIAGONALLY FROM CORNER TO CORNER.`  

7. From avant-garde composer and musician [La Monte Young](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Monte_Young), written in 1960 ([more of his text scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositions_1960#cite_note-9)):  
`#10 ("to Bob Morris")`  
`Instructions:`  
`Draw a straight line and follow it.` 


### INSPIRATION  
Each week, we'll look at examples of historical and contemporary makers who use code or whose work relates to the ideas we're talking about. They'll be shown with commentary in the assignment's video, but you can also find links in this section and (some of) the images in each week's `Images` folder:
