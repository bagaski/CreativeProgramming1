HELLO, WORLD!

(What you're seeing here a multiline comment – text that isn't
code but used as notes – and a single-line comment is below!)

Since the mid-1970s, it has been traditional that the first
program one learns to write is to have the computer
display the text "Hello, World!" (either to the screen, or
on some older systems, actually printed via a teletype).

The origin isn't entirely clear, but one possible source is
Brian Kernighan, an engineer at Bell Labs where the seminal
C language was developed. If you want to really nerd out,
you can read this giant collection of "Hello, World" examples
here: http://helloworldcollection.de

Not only is this our first program, but it also demonstrates
the very useful console.log() function, which lets us display
text in the console of our browser. This is used for debugging 
purposes, especially when working on larger or interactive
projects.

If you're using the P5JS editor, the console appears automatically,
but if you're working with another editor you'll need to turn
on the console:

+ Firefox: Tools > Web Developer > Web Console
+ Chrome:  View > Developer > Javascript Console
+ Safari:  Safari > Preferences > Advanced > Show Develop
           menu in menu bar, then...
           Develop > Show Javascript Console

CHALLENGES
+ Can you print other text to the console? What happens when you
  have multiple console.log() commands? Can you experiment with
  the console to print some interestingly-formatted text?
+ Learning the keyboard shortcut for the console is suuuper
  helpful! Look it up for your browser and try it a few times

function setup() {
  
    // the console.log() command displays ("prints") text
    // to the console below – text should be encolsed in
    // either single- or double-quotes
    console.log('Hello, world!');

    // all commands in Javscript/P5JS require a semicolon
    // at the end; this tells the browser that this is
    // the end of a command
}


function draw() {
    // nothing here yet!
