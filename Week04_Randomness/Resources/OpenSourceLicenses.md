OPEN SOURCE LICENSES
====

Below is a short overview of some common open source software licenses. If you want more details, Github's excellent [Choose-A-License site](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) has a description for each, plus detailed permissions, conditions, and limitations.

One term you'll see below is a distinction about how derivative works are handled – generally they fall into one of these two options:

* Permissive: sets minimal requirements for derivative works, usually does not require derivative works to be released under the same license  
* Copyleft: derivative works must be released under the same license terms
